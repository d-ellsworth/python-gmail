# python-gmail
Send gmail with python

Uses Google gmail API to send email from your gmail account to specified email address.

A `client_secret.json` file is required for this to run. Visit the [Google Developers page](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python) to set up your google account and create a `client_secret.json` file.

If running headless add the `--noauth_local_webserver` flag when running the first time or generating credentials. Not needed if you have already authenticated.
